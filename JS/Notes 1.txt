1.) Unlike Java, Scripts doesnt need to compile to run.

2.) can be used internally or externally'

<script>
 function onClick() { alert(“Clicked”); }
 </script>

<script src=“index.js”></script>

3.) JS can display data in 4 ways

document.getElementById(‘text1’).innerHTML = “This is a paragraph” ;
document.write(‘Hello World.’);// will delete whole HTML and replace it with content inside  '' quotes
window.alert(‘Hello World.’);
console.log(‘Hello World.’);


4.) JS is loosely coupled

5.) All JS variables must be identified with a unique name called identifier.

Rules for identifiers -
1. Names can contain letters, digits, the dollar sign (‘$’) and the underscore sign (‘_’).
2. Names should always begin with a letter.
3. JavaScript is case-sensitive, i.e., name and Name are different variables.
4. Reserved JS words cannot be used for an identifier.For ex - let,var,const etc
5. The best practice is to not keep a name, such as x, y, z, that does not indicate the meaning or 
significance of that variable. The identifier name should signify the meaning of the variable; for 
example, name and age.




6.) var city = "Berlin";
    console.log(city); // Berlin without quotes
