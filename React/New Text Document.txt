Class component, FUnction Component

Can a compoennt contains other component inside it ?

export multiple components from same file

default export vs simple export

package.json, package-lock.json

why node-modules not uploaded

npm install vs npm start

how to chnge npm start to npm run sid

props passing as single or object

events in class and function---> dont define funtion inside  return--whats the best way to define inside render or inside class

state,define it, its uses,update it, how it works,++c works fine but why c++ is issue
arrays,object in class and fucntion state



in state during class , the data is not lost if we dont use  ...this.state --> only in 1st level this.state={......}
but if we have this.state={.....,data:{.....}} and if we dont do  this.setState({data:{...this.state.data,updated value}}
then data one rest value will be lost


but in hook useState we have to give ....this.value else all the value will lost except we are updating
